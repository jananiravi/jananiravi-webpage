# Research program
Our research involves developing computational approaches that can leverage large-scale genomic data to gain actionable insights into infectious disease biology.
Specifically, we focus on three key areas:

i) Identifying genomic signatures, functions, and mechanisms relevant to host-pathogen interactions, to enable understanding and guide diagnosis, <br>
ii) Unraveling molecular mechanisms common between genetic and infectious diseases, to guide targeted drug repurposing, and <br>
iii) Developing tools and resources for seamlessly relating sequence, structure, and function of genes/proteins in poorly characterized pathogens to enable and guide better prevention, diagnostic and treatment regimen.
