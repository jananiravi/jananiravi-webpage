# Biography

I am a computational biologist ([Dept. of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation](https://cvm.msu.edu/pdi), [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/)) working on host-pathogen biology, protein sequence-structure-function relationships, and drug repurposing. I am interested in quantitative biology, like to code & develop methods, and enjoy being in a collaborative environment addressing interesting biological questions.

I also like teaching statistical data analysis and visualization, and R/Python programming. I recently founded the R programming chapter, [R-Ladies East Lansing](/post/2018/rladies-elansing), and co-host our [meetups](https://meetup.com/rladies-eastlansing) & [workshops](https://rladies-eastlansing.github.io/meetup-presentations-eastlansing/)! Check out our ß-webpage [here](https:rladies-eastlansing.github.io/).

I love to [read](/interests/reading) most non-fiction genres, sing classical carnatic music & dabble in keyboard, guitar!
