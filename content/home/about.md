# Biography

I am a computational biologist ([Dept. of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation](https://cvm.msu.edu/pdi), [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/)) working on host-pathogen biology, protein sequence-structure-function relationships, and drug repurposing. I am interested in quantitative biology, like to code & develop methods, and enjoy being in a collaborative environment addressing interesting biological questions. 

I also like [teaching](#talks) statistical data analysis and visualization, and R/Python programming. I recently founded the R programming chapter, R-Ladies East Lansing ([year in review](/post/2019/rlel-2018)), and co-host our [meetups](//meetup.com/rladies-eastlansing) & [workshops](//rladies-eastlansing.github.io/meetup-presentations-eastlansing/)! Check out our ÃŸ-webpage [here](//rladies-eastlansing.github.io/).

I love to [read](/reading) most non-fiction genres, sing classical carnatic music & dabble in keyboard, guitar!
