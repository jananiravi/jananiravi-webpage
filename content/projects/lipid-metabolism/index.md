## Research
In addition to stress-response systems on the pathogenic side, I studied some host responses to *M. tuberculosis* infection using computational approaches as well:

* characterizing the transcriptional response in infected macrophages under various small molecule perturbations using RNA-Seq analysis;
* understanding the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages using dynamic Bayesian model and statistical analyses of heterogeneous single-cell populations.
