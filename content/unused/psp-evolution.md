abstract = "The phage shock protein (Psp) stress-response system protects bacteria from envelope stress and stabilizes the cell membrane. The key effector protein, PspA, is found in diverse bacterial, archaeal and plant phyla. Despite the prevalence of the functional Psp system, the various genomic contexts of Psp proteins, as well as their evolution across the kingdoms of life, have not been characterized.  We developed a computational pipeline for comparative genomics and protein sequence-structure-function analyses to identify sequence homologs, phyletic patterns, domain architectures, gene neighborhoods, sequence conservation and evolution of the proteins and domains of interest across the tree of life (~6000 completed genomes).  We first determined PspA-containing species across the tree of life followed by the other known cognate partners of PspA (pspBC, pspMN, liaIGF). Using contextual information from conserved gene neighborhoods and their domain architectures, we delineated the phyletic patterns of all the Psp members. In addition to systematically identifying all possible ‘flavors’ and neighborhoods of the known Psp systems, we could also trace their evolution (e.g., back to LUCA for PspA) leading us to several interesting observations as to their occurrence and co-migration, suggesting their function and role in stress-response systems dependent and independent of PspA that are often lineage-specific."
