Currently, we prefer students coming in with fellowships/scholarships (e.g., SROP, ENSURE, other department/college-level awards).\nWe are happy to train them in many aspects of data-intensive biology. A keen interest in bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics/biostatistics, computer science, genetics, or related fields, and prior programming experience in R, Python, Perl, and/or C/C++ would be a huge plus. As part of this project, they will have the opportunity to work closely with a senior scientist and learn to: a) work with large datasets, b) write structured, well-documented code to analyze, integrate, and visualize these datasets, c) interpret the results in the context of pathogenesis, and d) communicate the results in the form of a paper and presentation.\nWe have high expectations for their level of commitment to research, and we are keen on incorporating their contributions into co-authored papers in conferences/journals. As an undergraduate student, if you are interested in discussing research opportunities, please send me an email to set up a time to talk.\nGraduate Student Research We are looking for a highly motivated Masters student who is looking to do an internship or a long-term project (6mo–1yr) in developing computational approaches to accelerate drug-/vaccine-target discovery against infectious diseases. You will be a perfect fit if you have a background in bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics/biostatistics, computer science, genetics, or related fields. Having programming experience in R, Python, Perl, and/or C/C++ is a huge plus. In addition to these technical qualifications, we are looking for someone who can work well in a team, work hard, and give/take constructive feedback.\nThis research experience will give you the opportunity to i) use data analysis and visualization to address key biological questions as pertaining to molecular evolution, diagnosis, and treatment (using R), ii) present at group meetings, journals, technical workshops and conferences, iii) develop high coding standards for writing efficient, clear, well-documented, version-controlled code, iv) equip yourself professional for your next career step.\nStart a conversation Please send me your latest CV and a cover letter that includes i) a summary of your academic/work experience, ii) description of relevant coursework, research experience (incl. publications, conference talks/posters), iii) a brief note on familiarity in the field of phylogenetics, molecular evolution, and comparative pathogenomics, iv) coding experience, if any. If you are already at MSU, please email me to set a time to meet and discuss your interest.\nVisiting Scientist We welcome visiting scientists to come and collaborate with us for a short period (summer/6mo). If you have a burning question or an interesting idea that is directly related to or complements our research project(s), we would be glad to share our space, experience, and resources with you to develop your project and execute it. Having your own funding would be the easiest way to make this happen. There are some funding sources that you can apply to (e.g., CoB). Please send me an email to discuss this opportunity.\nCollaboration If you are interested in any of our specific areas of research or have other great ideas that we could work on together, email me right away!\nContact details\n","date":1547528400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553486400,"objectID":"fba6c149775da15c6a5b2adae893dd1c","permalink":"/joinus/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/joinus/","section":"","summary":"Looking for undergrads, graduate students \u0026 visiting scientists!","tags":["jobs","evolution","datascience","bioinformatics","R"],"title":"Join us!","type":"page"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":["Resources"],"content":"","date":1547528400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547528400,"objectID":"d517e9ac1a63ba39aeede31c1178198a","permalink":"/talk/simple-rules-to-make-an-effective-scientific-presentation/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/simple-rules-to-make-an-effective-scientific-presentation/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["academic","R","research","plot","software-tools"],"title":"Simple rules to make an effective scientific presentation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":["Resources"],"content":"","date":1547528400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547528400,"objectID":"c44d15c476a7a30f3dbcc15148bdfdc7","permalink":"/talk/tidyverse-workshop/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tidyverse-workshop/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["academic","R","research","plot","software-tools"],"title":"Tidyverse workshop","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":null,"content":" Thanks to everyone who attended, participated or sponsored R-Ladies East Lansing in 2018!

Starting with Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow, followed by the writings and blogs of Steven Levitt, Dan Ariely, Nate Silver and Barry Schwartz (and still others like Malcolm Gladwell), has set me thinking a lot about how insane and illogical we are. We do see ourselves as logical and reasonably intelligent people who do not fall for the usual traps (OK, maybe you didn’t see me that way, but we’ll let that slide for now…), but how fool-proof are we? What about the narrative fallacy - ‘aah, that makes sense now’ or ‘I thought so’ or confirmation biases?\n‘The Black Swan’ by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (http://fooledbyrandomness.com/) has been on my list ever since I first got infatuated with this topic. I finally finished it last month. Man, is it it well-written! The guy is brilliant, and his wit and humor are unmatchable! Among other things, he leads (and concludes) with our love for everything normal, statistically speaking and otherwise, and how we can’t but help make the obvious blunders of predicting, quite erroneously, based on the past, even though we know fully well that life doesn’t present itself as a series of bell curves stringed together just so that we can get away with some easy math! You’ll hear a lot about epistemology (defined in PS3; truth be told, I hadn’t heard of this word until last month), mediocristan (the Gaussian life) vs extremistan (scale-free distributions encountered more often than not in real-life)\nHere’s a snippet: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7_wAV4HsNrkQmdFMndHSHhldFE/view Never mind if you don’t get it. I enjoyed every last bit of the book, and hope that you do too! Give it a try - whether you love it or hate it, it would be time well-spent! :)\nHappy reading!\nPS1. I’ve heard that people either love it or hate it. Clearly, I fall in the bin #1. Do I agree with everything? Well, yeah, almost everything. PS2. Luckily, none of you are directly tied to economics or financial sectors. :D Well, scientists and statisticians have been insulted too, but the elegance of it makes it OK! Lots to think about.:) PS3. Epistemology studies the nature of knowledge, justification, and the rationality of belief. Much of the debate in epistemology centers on four areas: (1) the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth, belief, and justification, (2) various problems of skepticism, (3) the sources and scope of knowledge and justified belief, and (4) the criteria for knowledge and justification.\nTags #behavioraleconomics #books #suggestions #mustread #randomness #economics #business #philosophy\nblurb, review, snapshot below\n  Blurb A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was.\nThe astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.\nWhy do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities.\nWe concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”\nFor years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.\nElegant, startling, and universal in its applications ‘The Black Swan’ will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory.\n‘The Black Swan’ is a landmark book – itself a black swan.\n ","date":1493164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493164800,"objectID":"8b40a96d92f81a37e1ff06d49df422fa","permalink":"/post/2017/black-swan-nassim-taleb/","publishdate":"2017-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017/black-swan-nassim-taleb/","section":"post","summary":"Brief book review/book recommendation.","tags":["books","review","authors","behavioral-economics"],"title":"Black Swan by Nassim Taleb","type":"post"},{"authors":["*Janani Ravi*","V Anantharaman","L Aravind","ML Gennaro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491019200,"objectID":"a7e54386f219201ea221cf704105e281","permalink":"/talk/evolution-and-conservation-of-the-psp-envelope-stress-response-system/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/evolution-and-conservation-of-the-psp-envelope-stress-response-system/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Psp","evolution"],"title":"Evolution and Conservation of the Psp Envelope Stress-Response System","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Resources"],"content":"  About Me Why I’m writing this The initial process, where you read and imbibe!

So, most of the state department and RPO/police verification guidelines I’ve enlisted below worked for my specific case.

Mine was Tamil Nadu. Other useful PDFs that may include some of the above: The_process     Approximate order of key events \u0026amp; things-to-do  Read \u0026amp; decipher the resources. It’s a one-time thing. So, do it! Start at least 1–1.5yrs before your current employment ends/your extended J1 expires. The process takes time \u0026amp; patience. Give time for ‘worst case scenarios’! Tip: Talk to your department admin and your university’s international/J1 office. Note: First extend your J1 \u0026amp; then apply for the waiver. You can’t extend once you apply for your waiver. Notarization of your biodata and affidavit (your local bank or other notary publics) Attestation of your biodata and affidavit: Local Indian consulate with the necessary documents  Some require passport-sized photo taken within the last 6 mo (CGNY did ‘require’ but they didn’t ’need’ it!!)

Talk to both the universities’ J1 departments. This would take 24-48h but can only happen before you terminate your current appointment. Once you are out, you need to process a new J1 and, possibly, go this whole process once again! This could happen even while your J1 is being petitioned.

Here we reconstruct the complete sigma factor regulatory network of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis by an integrated approach. The approach combines identification of direct regulatory interactions between M. tuberculosis sigma factors in an E. coli model system, validation of selected links in M. tuberculosis, and extensive literature review. The resulting network comprises 41 direct interactions among all 13 sigma factors. Analysis of network topology reveals (i) a three-tiered hierarchy initiating at master regulators, (ii) high connectivity and (iii) distinct communities containing multiple sigma factors. These topological features are likely associated with multi-layer signal processing and specialized stress responses involving multiple sigma factors. Moreover, the identification of overrepresented network motifs, such as autoregulation and coregulation of sigma and anti-sigma factor pairs, provides structural information that is relevant for studies of network dynamics.","tags":["Mtb"],"title":"Reconstruction and topological characterization of the sigma factor regulatory network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Research In addition to stress-response systems on the pathogenic side, I studied some host responses to M. tuberculosis infection using computational approaches as well:\n characterizing the transcriptional response in infected macrophages under various small molecule perturbations using RNA-Seq analysis; understanding the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages using dynamic Bayesian model and statistical analyses of heterogeneous single-cell populations.

In Gram-negative bacteria, envelope integrity during stress is maintained by the multi-gene Psp response. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was thought to lack the Psp system since it encodes only pspA and no other psp ortholog. Intriguingly, pspA maps downstream from clgR, which encodes a transcription factor regulated by the MprAB-σ(E) envelope-stress-signaling system. clgR inactivation lowered ATP concentration during stress and protonophore treatment-induced clgR-pspA expression, suggesting that these genes express Psp-like functions. We identified a four-gene set - clgR, pspA (rv2744c), rv2743c, rv2742c - that is regulated by clgR and in turn regulates ClgR activity. Regulatory and protein-protein interactions within the set and a requirement of the four genes for functions associated with envelope integrity and surface-stress tolerance indicate that a Psp-like system has evolved in mycobacteria. Among Actinobacteria, the four-gene module occurred only in tuberculous mycobacteria and was required for intramacrophage growth, suggesting links between its function and mycobacterial virulence. Additionally, the four-gene module was required for MprAB-σ(E) stress-signaling activity. The positive feedback between envelope-stress-sensing and envelope-preserving functions allows sustained responses to multiple, envelope-perturbing signals during chronic infection, making the system uniquely suited to tuberculosis pathogenesis.","tags":["Psp","Mtb"],"title":"The Psp system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis integrates envelope stress-sensing and envelope-preserving functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Invited talk ","date":1414728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414728000,"objectID":"f6b4f57dd933a921edaddda1e9ecd788","permalink":"/talk/mathematical-modeling-of-pathways-involved-in-cell-cycle-regulation-and-differentiation/","publishdate":"2014-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mathematical-modeling-of-pathways-involved-in-cell-cycle-regulation-and-differentiation/","section":"talk","summary":" Invited talk ","tags":null,"title":"Mathematical modeling of pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and Differentiation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["H Salamon","N Bruiners","K Lakehal","L Shi","*J Ravi*","KD Yamaguchi","R Pine","ML Gennaro"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1404187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404187200,"objectID":"605cb9dc5a1258eccc8208939236204d","permalink":"/publication/2014/jimm/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2014/jimm/","section":"publication","summary":"Vitamin D has long been linked to resistance to tuberculosis, an infectious respiratory disease that is increasingly hard to treat because of multidrug resistance. Previous work established that vitamin D induces macrophage antimicrobial functions against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this article, we report a novel, metabolic role for vitamin D in tuberculosis identified through integrated transcriptome and mechanistic studies. Transcriptome analysis revealed an association between vitamin D receptor (VDR) and lipid metabolism in human tuberculosis and infected macrophages. Vitamin D treatment of infected macrophages abrogated infection-induced accumulation of lipid droplets, which are required for intracellular M. tuberculosis growth. Additional transcriptomics results showed that vitamin D downregulates the proadipogenic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in infected macrophages. PPARγ agonists reversed the antiadipogenic and the antimicrobial effects of VDR, indicating a link between VDR and PPARγ signaling in regulating both vitamin D functions. These findings suggest the potential for host-based, adjunct antituberculosis therapy targeting lipid metabolism.","tags":["Mtb"],"title":"Cutting edge: Vitamin D regulates lipid metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Research During my graduate research with Dr John Tyson, I built mathematical models to understand dynamical aspects:\n Modeling the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle:\n Built a detailed mathematical model (~100 ODEs, ~150 parameters) for the START transition in yeast and integrated it with our published model of the whole cell cycle.
