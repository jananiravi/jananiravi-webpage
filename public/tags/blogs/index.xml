      <title>Modeler&#39;s Hippocratic Oath</title>

      <description>I recently came across the Modeler&amp;rsquo;s Hippocratic Oath while reading Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Weapons of Math Destruction&amp;rsquo;.
This was originally written by Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmott in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
The Oath  I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it doesn’t satisfy my equations. Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics. I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so.</description>
