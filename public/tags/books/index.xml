      <title>Black Swan by Nassim Taleb</title>

      <description>Book Review I find myself increasingly drawn to the field of Behavioral Economics (so much so that I was considering a second PhD to channelize my love!), and how beautifully evasive these concepts are in real life. Starting with Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow, followed by the writings and blogs of Steven Levitt, Dan Ariely, Nate Silver and Barry Schwartz (and still others like Malcolm Gladwell), has set me thinking a lot about how insane and illogical we are.</description>

      <title>Becoming Steve Jobs by Brent Schlender</title>

      <description>Becoming Steve Jobs by Brent Schlender is a well-written biography of Steve Jobs &amp;amp; is definitely much better than Walter Isaacson’s ‘official’ one! And yeah, it is much more than a boring compendium of wiki and news articles. :)
So, happy reading!</description>

      <description>Authors: Janani Ravi, Arjun Krishnan
Srinivasa Ramanujan has been noted as one of the classic ‘genius-mathematicians’ of all time! Hailing from the same state/country as him, Arjun Krishnan and I have always looked up to him &amp;amp; his elegant math as a source of inspiration right through our formative years!
The Movie Recent movie that has drastically increased Ramanujan’s international visibility The Man Who Knew Infinity by Matthew Brown.</description>
