      <description>Our research involves developing computational approaches that can leverage large-scale genomic data to gain actionable insights into infectious disease biology. Specifically, we focus on three key areas:
i) Identifying genomic signatures, functions, and mechanisms relevant to host-pathogen interactions, to enable understanding and guide diagnosis, ii) Unraveling molecular mechanisms common between genetic and infectious diseases, to guide targeted drug repurposing, and iii) Developing tools and resources for seamlessly relating sequence, structure, and function of genes/proteins in poorly characterized pathogens to enable and guide better prevention, diagnostic and treatment regimen.</description>

      <description>Open positions Undergraduate Student Research We are looking for highly motivated and quantitatively-minded undergraduate students to work on a research project developing computational approaches to accelerate drug-/vaccine-target discovery against infectious diseases. Currently, we prefer students coming in with fellowships/scholarships (e.g., SROP, ENSURE, other department/college-level awards).
We are happy to train them in many aspects of data-intensive biology. A keen interest in bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics/biostatistics, computer science, genetics, or related fields, and prior programming experience in R, Python, Perl, and/or C/C++ would be a huge plus.</description>

      <title>Modeler&#39;s Hippocratic Oath</title>
      <link>https://jananiravi.github.io/post/2018/modelers-hippocratic-oath/</link>

      <description>I recently came across the Modeler&amp;rsquo;s Hippocratic Oath while reading Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Weapons of Math Destruction&amp;rsquo;.
This was originally written by Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmott in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
The Oath  I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it doesn’t satisfy my equations. Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics. I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so.</description>
